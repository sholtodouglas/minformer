It fits us perfectly.\"\n",

       "'One day, a nice girl named Lucy went to school. She wore a uniform. It was a pretty dress with a blue bow.\\nAt school, Lucy saw her friend Tom. Tom had a hole in his uniform. \"Oh no, Tom! Your uniform has a hole,\" she said. Tom was sad. He did not know what to do.\\nLucy had an idea. She went home and asked her mom to help. They found a new uniform for Tom. They replaced the old one with the new one. Tom was happy. \"Thank you, Lucy!\" he said. They played together and had a great day at school.\\n<|endoftext|>Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to eat pastry. One day, she saw a pastry shop and went inside to buy her favorite treat. The shop was full of yummy pastries, and Lucy was very happy.\\nLucy picked a pastry that was very hard. She didn\\'t know why it was hard, but she wanted to try it. She took a bite, and suddenly, something unexpected happened. The hard pastry turned soft and sweet in her mouth. Lucy was very surprised and happy.\\nThen, Lucy learned that the pastry was magic! The shop owner told her that when you eat the pastry, you can reverse time. Lucy was so excited. She ate more of the magic pastry and went back in time to play with her friends all over again. And they all lived happily ever after.\\n<|endoftext|>One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mom. They saw a regular bike that Lily wanted to ride. Her mom said okay and let her ride the bike. Lily was very happy and excited.\\nWhile Lily was riding the bike, a stranger came to the park. The stranger had a big bag with him. He put the bag down and opened it. Lily and her mom watched him, wondering what was inside.\\nThe stranger took out a big, colorful kite from the bag. He started to fly the kite high in the sky. Lily and her mom were surprised and happy to see the beautiful kite. They had thought the stranger was scary, but he just wanted to have fun at the park too. So, they all played together and had a great day at the park.\\n<|endoftext|>One day, a blue bird and a mosquito were talking in the garden. The blue bird said, \"I can fly high in the sky and see everything!\" The mosquito said, \"I can fly too, but I like to stay close to the ground.\"\\nThe blue bird saw a big, sweet cake on a table near the house. He wanted to eat it all but knew he should resist. The mosquito saw the cake too and said, \"Let\\'s share the cake!\" The blue bird agreed and they both flew down to the table.\\nAs they were eating the cake, a little girl came out of the house. She saw the blue bird and mosquito eating her cake. The little girl was sad, but she knew she should share. She said, \"You can have some cake, but please leave some for me.\"\\nThe blue bird and mosquito felt bad for eating the little girl\\'s cake. They decided to share it with her and all became friends. The moral of the story is to always share and resist taking things that are not yours.\\n<|endoftext|>One day, a little girl named Mia went on a walk with her dad. They wanted to discover new things. Mia was very excited. The sun was shining and the weather was fine.\\nAs they walked, Mia saw a big store. \"Dad, what is that?\" she asked. Her dad said, \"That is a coffee shop. People go there to drink coffee and talk with their friends.\"\\nThey went inside the coffee shop. Mia\\'s dad bought a cup of coffee. He let Mia take a little sip. \"Yuck!\" she said. \"Coffee is not for me!\" They both laughed and continued their walk, happy to have discovered something new together.\\n<|endoftext|>One day, a boy named Tim went on a trip with his mom. They went to the big store to buy some toys. Tim was very anxious because he wanted a new toy car.\\nIn the store, Tim saw many toy cars. He looked at them and said, \"Mom, I want this one!\" His mom looked at the price and said, \"Okay, Tim. We can buy it.\"\\nThey bought the toy car and went back home. Tim was happy and played with his new toy car all day. His mom was happy too because she saw her child smile. They had a great trip to the store.\\n<|endoftext|><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>'"
